description: Hi! I'm Ravi. Welcome to my website! I'm a californian born and raised (never lived anywhere else). I'm passionate about the environment, education equality, and finance. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a Masters in Operations Research where I had the opportunity to learn and practice data science and product skills. I completed my bachelors at USC in Chemical Engineering with a minor in Business Finance. Here are a selection of projects that I would like to share with you!
